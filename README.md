This is the code for my personal portfolio.

It was created from scratch utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In particular, the extra library Chart.JS was utilized to create dynamic, interactive doughnut graphs.

It was also an exercise in media queries, as the site is fully responsive across three different views, mobile, tablet, and larger screen, and designed to convey my design sensibilities and overall work flow to potential employers.
