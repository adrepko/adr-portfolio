          <p>I’ve always been low-key competitive - or perhaps to phrase it differently, I have always been extremely competitive against myself. Whenever I put my effort into a hobby or a new venture,
            this has often worked against me. After all, if I’m not immediately a top performer, why bother keeping at it? Might as well stop. It has taken me decades to unlearn this philosophy, a
            process that began with, of all things, ballroom dance. In a field full of people who have been studying since they were four, after all, how am I going to instantly rise to the top? This
            has forced me to, essentially, re-learn how to learn.</p>

          <p>This led to my interest in design. I was speaking with a couple of friends who got into the field of educational design, and I took a look into it, but it wasn’t quite what I was looking
            for. Investigating web design and UX design afterward, it seemed like the perfect blend of self-expression and technical ability that I was looking for. Much like dance, it’s a field that
            allows me to develop my own sense and aesthetic, giving me a way to present that to the world at large and to experience a wide variety of styles and restrictions in ways that prompt my
            growth and evolution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio standardtext">
          <p>I want to see what the future of design brings. Even in just my short time exploring the field, I have started to analyse the development of design and styling in sites I use now and used
            in the past, how they themselves have changed and evolved over time. And I want to be part of that vanguard, to see what limits exist and how to surpass them.</p>
