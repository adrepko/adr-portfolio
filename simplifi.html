              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>Many people struggle with budgeting for a number of reasons. Either current tools don’t work for them, they’re nervous about facing the truth of their financial reality, or they
                simply have no idea how to start. No current budgeting app serves these markets and helps to introduce people to budgeting.</p>
              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>The solution was simplifi, a budgeting app prioritizing new budgeters while also providing useful tools for those with more experience. The primary goal was to provide easy access
                to budgeting by starting them off with three categories of expenses and the ability to set individual goals, then track their expenses by linking chosen accounts and analyzing their
                expenses in order to help them develop and specialize their budget, in essence teaching them how to budget.</p>
              <h3>Discovery & Strategy</h3>
              <p>The first step was looking at competitors to see what they offered, and where simplifi could find ways to attract its own audience. Of the current major options, we selected Mint,
                Wally, and You Need a Budget (YNAB), and then performed a SWOT analysis and found a couple of key opportunities:</p>
              <ul class="standard_list">
                <li>• Mint offers a look at your complete financial health, and is free but at the cost of ads and lacks a focus</li>
                <li>• Wally is a good mobile-first app with good foreign currency support, but it only offers snapshots of financial health, and the devs have stated they are working on premium
                  features that will require subscription</li>
                <li>• YNAB takes a pro-active approach to budgeting, but has monthly subscription fees and is overwhelming for new budgeters</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Wireframes, Lofi Prototyping & User Testing</h3>
            <p>The first round of wireframes was designed specifically for usability, to attempt to put to paper (so to speak) the user flows above while trying to flesh out the basic design of
              the page.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="buttonlink innerlink">

          </div>

          <div class="standardtext">
            <p>We conducted our first round of testing here, with four tasks:</p>
            <ul class="standard_list">
              <li>• Sign up for an account</li>
              <li>• Add a bank account</li>
              <li>• Set a goal</li>
              <li>• Edit a budget line item</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="standardtext">
            <p>This first prototype ran afoul of users almost immediately. When conducting a Maze test and in-person testing, the Add Account page was poorly explained and resulted in a
              mere 33% success rate on the page.</p>
              <!-- Image goes here -->
            <p>This necessitated a revision.</p>
            <p>The revision worked better. However, outside of the Add Account confusion, there was very little confusion. Users had no real issue, and there were some good reviews, specifically one
              user mentioned that he appreciated the ability to set an end date to the goal as a way to help measure concrete progress.</p>
            <p>Once the Add Account page was fixed and flows were re-evaluated and confirmed to work as intended, we were ready to step into branding.</p>

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>First we started with brainstorming on the app using a mindmap.</p>
            <!-- Image goes here -->
            <p>I started with the concept of zen, which branched off into mindfulness and calm, which are core elements of zen, as well as the Japanese word “anzen” which means safety or security.
              These would become watchwords for the mood I wanted to create, and they helped me to define the product, which at the time was nameless.</p>
            <h3>Logo Design</h3>
            <p>Next I worked on logo design, which also helped me to workshop names. I hit on a number of concepts, though the word “zen” was still at the forefront of my thought process. So most of my
              early attempts had some play on that word.<br><br>
              Eventually, I pivoted to the concept of simplifi, here shown as being conceptually divided into three per the three categories from the card sort. However, I settled on something a bit
              less convoluted and more straightforward:</p>

          <section class="brand section innergrid">
            <div class="standardtext">
              <p>The palette was tied to the concept of simplicity. The original attempts focused on earth tones and pastel colors, but did not convey the desired mood. Instead, we shifted toward a
                more neutral presentation with a couple of deep, rich colors designed to remind of home, comfort, and stability while still promoting the concept of growth and education. The green and
                brown here, in a design that merges the s and f while resembling a tree, reinforced that.</p>

            <p>For the second test, our testers were asked to perform a similar set of tasks to the first, but then were also asked to go into the analysis and view a one-month analysis of their

              coloration of the app. The biggest suggestion was about the possible use of widgets to help guide new users, but as there were no hangups in the testing this suggestion was ultimately

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>All told, I feel satisfied with the final result, if not entirely with the road it took to get there. My initial vision for the final project, using the sandy-brown color for a background,
            backfired significantly, as very few people were receptive to the design. I appreciate the final product as it is, it’s a very streamlined and stylized product that encourages thoughtful
            interaction, which I want to make the hallmark of my design style. My concern is how much of that was me and how much of that was the input I received. And whether that even makes a
            difference.<br><br>
            What surprised me the most was how quick I was to bounce back and implement much of the feedback I received. I feel that even moreso than my first outing, I was able to conceptualize and
            act on the key elements of design in this product.<br><br>
          Going forward with this product, the key things I would do would be to set a pricepoint - I’d want to avoid the ad-based revenue of Mint, and subscription services can feel predatory.
          Instead I would want to make the app free to a point, with a one-time purchase to unlock the analytical capabilities of the app. This could also potentially lead to a tie-in with local CPAs
          who might be able to provide extra extended analyses to clients.<br><br>
          Personally moving forward, I would like to develop a stronger sense of aesthetics in order to avoid missteps like the one I made in the middle of my development here with the color palette
          and the application of that palette. I feel that it will require a good deal of work to fully realize exactly how these discrete elements come together and how they should be applied, and it
          is something I will work on going forward.</p>
