              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>How would a new company approach cloud sharing from the music side of things? SoundCloud already exists and is doing great, so what grounds have gone yet-uncovered that can be explored
              more fully without trying to compete directly with them? What spaces exist for a second music-focused cloud sharing app?</p>
              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>The solution was InStereo, a cloud storage service that combined all of the tools that musicians and creators looked for, focusing on the collaboration that respondents in the survey
                indicated a serious desire for as well as the ability to explore a wide variety of music through a random music function. By offering a free option as well as centering the cheapest
                option and highlighting it, multiple usability test respondents admitted that they felt that it was friendly rather than predatory and that they were more likely to consider a paid
                option when presented with the data in that manner.</p>
              <h3>Discovery & Strategy</h3>
              <p>The first step was trying to look at competitors and see what they had on offer, and where InStereo could potentially carve out its own niche. Specifically, I selected SoundCloud,
                  Google Drive, and Notion.so. I performed a SWOT analysis of all three and found a couple of key opportunities.</p>
              <ul class="standard_list">
                <li>SoundCloud as a platform does not commit to collaboration between its users</li>
                <li>Notion.so is a good way to aggregate content in dedicated workspaces, but has limited editing capability</li>
                <li>Google Drive is inflexible and while it has a broad appeal, more dedicated products can offer better specific alternatives</li>
              </ul>

                service. Surveys were deployed to discover what options existed.</p>
            <p>What was discovered was that a lot of independent musicians and local bands were spread over so many different services for storage, communication, collaboration, et cetera, while many
                music creators simply found it hard to find truly new music experiences with the prevalence of algorithmic experiences.</p>

                aspects of the site, including as high priority flows the ability to access PDFs, upload music to the cloud, and the ability to discover new music on the site.</p>

              the page.</p>

            <p>User testing on this clickable prototype yielded some very good information. By testing a range of users, I gathered information that allowed us to locate a number of pain points.
              Far and above the most useful response was the individual who experienced a number of unexpected pain points that did not occur among the other two participants. Particularly, the user
              experienced a great amount of difficulty in both the flow for uploading a file and the flow for playing a random piece of music, largely due to verbiage and unintuitive placement of
              buttons.<br><br>
              While this could have been overlooked if it were just one particular moment of hesitation, that it was an issue across multiple screens suggested that there were issues with the design
              for a subset of users that needed to be addressed.</p>

          <div class="standardtext">
            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>To begin the brand development process, I started with a mind map focused on music and collaboration. From there, I gave a great deal of consideration to the types of people who would
              associate with the brand, what associations I wanted it to have, and most importantly, what to evoke in people who utilized the site. Given the subject of music, I felt that passion and
              energy were two key watchwords to focus on.</p>
            <h3>Logo Design</h3>
            <p>The logo concept started with a fairly scattershot approach. Initial concepts consisted of boomboxes and music notes, then shifted to stereo faces and digital interfaces, as well as
              paraphernalia associated with music and stereos. However, the idea that sparked the most curiosity was the waveform.<br><br>
              I recorded myself in Audacity saying “IS”, playing at the time with the idea of the logo as initials of the brand, and used that waveform as the foundation.<br><br>
              The logo itself went through a number of adjustments, starting initially with the “IS” concept. However, this quickly gave way to a more standard but unpolished presentation, and then
              to a simplified but striking logo.</p>

            <p>The second round of testing was considerably more involved, and came in two waves. The first was preference testing, which analyzed user preferences in regards to functional and
              aesthetic approaches.</p>

            <p>Next came the second round of usability testing. This time around, there were no issues  related to user flows, but instead testers conflicted over aesthetic decisions. This led to
              a second round of preference testing, which produced near-unanimous results.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>With regards to doubts going into the project, I felt a very real sense of imposter syndrome many times, wondering if I had any real sense of design and understanding. However, as the
            project marched on, what surprised me was the way that individual elements, through iteration, began to congeal into a coherent whole.<br><br>
            If given more time, I would probably have spent more time looking at sites like dribbbler for potential inspiration for more specific elements, but in forcing myself to stay the course
            and work largely from my own concepts I think I’ve forced myself to adapt and develop in a lot of ways. Going forward in future projects, I certainly want to utilize a broader number of
            resources for inspiration and to hopefully make some of the in-between parts less painful, to feel less frustrated and nervous with what seems like a lack of development and instead focus
            on the iterative process to develop my own eye and a better understanding of my own personal aesthetic.</p>
